It covers basics of threat modelling, identifying threat actors and adversaries, models of trust, elements of formal verification, cryptography, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Introduction to security. Trust vs verifiability. Adversarial threat models. Notions of secrecy, privacy, and security. Basics of cryptography - symmetric and public key encryption, authentication, hash functions, digital signatures, certificates, cryptographic protocols, and applications. Cryptographic security definitions. Models of authentication and authorisation; biometrics; identity. Issues with verification of hardware and software integrity; the frameworks of formal verification and model checking. Trust assumptions, distributing trust with secure multiparty computations, hardware trust models, trusted computing environments and remote attestation. Elements of OS and Network security.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class="cmsDescp"><p>This course will help students reason concretely about real-world problems through case studies. This course will not cover design of security systems, but will cover requirement analysis methods and threat modelling. It will also familiarise them with commonly used security tools and measures in everyday life.</p>

Make-ups may be allowed only for midterm and final exams only due to illness on production of a medical certificate clearly stating that the student was not in a position to take the test. A medical prescription will not be sufficient.</p>
